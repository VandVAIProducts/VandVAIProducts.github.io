# title: Verification and Validation (V&V) for Machine Learning (ML) Models
description: "This lecture provides an overview of Verification and Validation (V&V) for Machine Learning (ML) Models. It covers V&V definitions, scope differences, activities, and standards. It also discusses the importance of V&V as a critical step in product development process, especially for AI products that often consists of machine learning (ML) models. If time permits, it will discuss V&V techniques to verify input-output specification and find failure modes for ML models through class activities."

<!-- ## Course: Verification and Validation (V&V) for AI Products -->

### Session X: Verification and Validation (V&V) for Machine Learning (ML) Models

<!-- **Abstract:** Verification and validation (V&V) are essential activities in product development. V&V ensures that the product meets the technical specifications as well as user requirements. Verification is the process of determining whether the product is built correctly, while validation is the process of determining whether the right product is built. In this session, we will review V&V definitions, scope differences, activities, and standards. We will discuss the importance of V&V as a critical step in product development process, especially for AI products that often consists of machine learning (ML) models. We will also highlight how V&V frameworks can help in risk management and technology readiness assessment. If time permits, we will discuss V&V techniques to verify input-output specification and find failure modes for ML models through class activities. Students are expected to participate actively in discussions and class activities. Pre-reading materials are available both in the course website and attached. By the end of this session, students will be able to identify V&V task, argue their critical importance as part of product development process, describe methods and activities to carry out V&V in practice, and give examples of falsification techniques to find failures for ML models. -->

Verification and validation (V&V) are essential activities in product development. V&V ensures that the product meets the technical specifications as well as user requirements. *Verification* is the process of determining whether the product is built correctly, while *validation* is the process of determining whether the right product is built. In this session,

- we will review V&V definitions, scope differences, activities, and standards;
- we will discuss the importance of V&V as a critical step in product development process, especially for AI products that often consists of machine learning (ML) models;
- we will also highlight how V&V frameworks can help in risk management and technology readiness assessment;
- time permitting, we will discuss V&V techniques to verify input-output specification and find failure modes of ML models through class activities.
